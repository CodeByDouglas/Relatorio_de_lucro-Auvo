Introduction

























    Auvo API V2.0  










Introduction










Auvo API provides a representation of the data found in your account at 
Auvo
.
We follow 
REST
 principles, so the API is stateless and http methods and response codes are used whenever possible.


The url for the requests is: 
https://api.auvo.com.br/v2


Media Types


This API use JSON format to represent resources. When sending content on 
PUT
/
PATCH
/
POST
 requests, you 
must
 specify the follow header:


Content-Type: application/json


Response Codes


The common 
HTTP Response Status Codes
 are used.


You will often see:






200 (OK) - GET and PATCH methods






201 (Created) - POST methods






204 (No content) - DELETE methods.






Error States


When something goes wrong, the response status code can be 
4xx
 if the error is related to your request structure or 
5xx
 if it's our server's fault.


Example:






400 (Bad request) - Check your request.






403 (Forbidden) - Rate limit temporarily exceeded.






404 (Not found) - The requested resource could not be found.






415 (Unsupported media type) - POST /tasks, when the Content-Type header is not defined






500 (Internal server error) - When a request throws an unexpected error. If you see this status code, please contact us: help@auvo.com.br






Authentication


Before having access to the API, the user 
must
 request the authorization token by making a POST to /login, containing the 
API key
 and 
API Token
 within the body, or a GET
containing the 
API key
 and 
API Token
 within the query parameter.
The authorization token lasts 30 minutes and must be renewed by making a new login request. Every request must have the authorization token in the header with the key 
Authorization
 followed by the valeu Bearer + 
authorization token
.

API key
 and 
API Token
 can be found by accesing 
Menu > Integração
 in your Auvo's account


Rate-limiting


The API has rate limits to ensure stable performance. A single IP address can make up to 
400
 requests per minute (60 seconds). Exceeding this limit may result in temporary restrictions or throttling.


If the limit is reached, the user will receive an HTTP 
status code 403
 with the following message in the response body:


{ "error": "Rate limit temporarily exceeded" }.


This indicates that too many requests were made in a short period, and the user should wait before retrying.

      Webhooks    








Notifier


A webhook (also called a web callback or HTTP push API) is a way for an app to provide other applications with real-time information.
The webhook will make an HTTP post request to the URL registered, and the client side will then be charged with interpreting it.
As an example of a webhook for registered task, the requests will have a body with the following structure:
